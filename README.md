# COMP-1800-1712-Project
CompCampus  helps students look for relevant computing/computer science programs in the Greater Vancouver Area. The site asks the users a series of questions in a survey that determines what jobs, positions, and programs might be relevant to their interests. Users can also bypass this to access all the information.

We also include breakdowns of the differences between programs such as cost and duration.
